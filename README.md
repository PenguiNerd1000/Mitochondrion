# Mitochondrion

## Background

This is a project to create my own esoteric programming language with the following requirements:

1. Accept integers and strings
2. Have user input(keyboard) and output
3. Perform math computations(+/-/*///%)
4. Perform conditions(just if’s are fine, int and String compare will be just fine)
5. Loops(can be any type of loop and as simple as you want it to be)
6. Display SIMPLE errors if the code “doesn’t compile”
7. have Line comments

## Inspiration

The Mitochondrion language is meant to be a cell based 
The inspiration behind mitochondrion is drawn from many sources: 

1. Brainf*** - [https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck)
2. COW - [https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW](https://esolangs.org/wiki/COW)
3. Assembly - [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=aix-assembler-language-reference](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=aix-assembler-language-reference)

## Features

1. String, integer, double, boolean data types
2. Perform basic math expressions
3. User input
4. Conditionals
5. Loops
6. Line comments
7. Error messages

## Syntax

1. POWER = print memory
2. POWEr = set memory
3. POWeR = get memory
4. POWer = opening parenthesis
5. PoWER = closing parenthesis
6. PoWEr = if
7. PoWeR = else if
8. PoWer = else
9. PowER = equals
10. PowEr = not
11. PoweR = or
12. Power = and
13. pOWER = greater than
14. pOWEr = less than
15. pOWeR = addition
16. pOWer = subtraction
17. poWER = multiplication
18. poWEr = division
19. poWeR = modulus
20. poWer = for loop
21. powER = user input
22. powEr = increment index
23. poweR = decrement index
24. power = line comments
